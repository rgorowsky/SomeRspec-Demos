# SomeRspec-Demos
Recalling some concepts I worked through for targeting dynamic elements using Rspec framework for QA Purposes

# SomeRspec-Demos
This is a collection of best practices on how to utilize the rspec framework to run automated scripts in browser, or headless.  Bonus things I'd like to remember for reference include utilizing page object model, running REST API calls in line with a test for data setup and breakdown, digging into the shadow-root for dynamic elements.

## Run Tests Locally.
* `git checkout main`
* `git pull`
* `bundle install` or `bundle exec rake setup` if it's your first time running the repo
* `rspec`
  * This will run ALL the selenium tests using Google Chrome
